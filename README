Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------
Program O is an AIML interpretor written in PHP, and uses a MySQL database to store
chatbot information, including the AIML files used to formulate the chatbot's responses.


Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.1 has support for multiple chatbots. Configuration of the individual bots is done from
inside the admin area. Bot specific variables are stored in the database. Configuration
of Program O itself is done in /config/global_config.php

Using the bot
---------------------------------------------------------
After installation you can chat to Program O in one of 3 ways:
-HTML form (example in /gui/plain/index.php)
-HTML form using AJAX (example in /gui/jquery/index.php)
-send XML using simpleXML (example in /gui/xml/index.php)

For advanced botmasters and programmers, it is also possible to use the XML/JSON
interfaces to access a chatbot from stand-alone applications through HTTP requests.
for information on how to create and/or use such a stand-alone application, please
visit the Program O Support Forums at http://www.program-o.com

Foreign Language Support
---------------------------------------------------------
v2.2.1 has support for foreign languages including and not limited to chinese, greek, french, arabic, turkish, thai

Upgrade
---------------------------------------------------------
Upgrading from version 1 to version 2 is handled through the automatic install script
that comes with the package. Upgrading "major revisions" from version 2.0.x to 2.1
and higher is accomplished through an upgrade script, and should be automatic, as well.
Please note that minor revisions won't use an upgrade script.

Clean install
---------------------------------------------------------
Starting with version 2.0.1 and later, there is an automatic installer provided for clean
installation. Simply point your web browser to your freshly uploaded Program O directory
to run the install script. Then follow the instructions on the page. The installer is
designed to only run once.

Please note that the installer script will NOT  create your database for you, nor will
it install your bot's AIML files. The database, along with the username/password used to
access it, needs to be created in advance. See the file FRESH_INSTALL_README.txt for more
information.

After you create the database, and once you complete the installation process, simply go to
your new Program O admin page (e.g. http://www.example.com/ProgramO/admin) and log in using
the admin credentials you provided during the install process. Then select "Upload AIML"
from the navigation link on the left and upload your AIML files. Then sit back and enjoy your
new bot!
