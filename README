Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------
Program O is an AIML interpretor written in PHP
The bot engine sits in the /chatbot/ directory
The admin area can be found in the /admin/ directory
Functions used by the bot and the admin area are in the /library/ directory
Any optional addons are found in the /chatbot/addons/ directory

Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.1 has support for multiple bots
Configuration of the individual bots is done from inside the admin area.
Bot specific variables are stored in the database.
Configuration of Program O itself is done in /config/global_config.php

Using the bot
---------------------------------------------------------
After installation you can chat to Program O in one of 3 ways
-HTML form (example in /gui/plain/index.php or /gui/jquery/index.php)
-HTML form using CURL (return response in XML or JSON) (example in /gui/htmltoxml/index.php)
-send XML using CURL (return response in XML or JSON) (example in /gui/xml/index.php)

There is also a (very experimental) demo page for using Program O with Twitter. This
page will require a bit of configuration and 'tweaking' to suit it to any sort of use.
Consider it to be nothing more than a "proof of concept".

Upgrade
---------------------------------------------------------
If you are upgrading from v1 you will need to make the following changes to the db
Back up your old files then overwrite with the new ones

Clean install
---------------------------------------------------------
v2.0.1 has an automatic installer for clean installation.
Simply point your web browser to your freshly uploaded
Program O directory to run the install script. Then
follow the instructions on the page. The installer is
designed to only run once.
Please note that the installer script will NOT install your
bot's AIML files. Once you complete the installation
process, simply go to your new Program O admin page
(e.g. http://www.example.com/ProgramO/admin) and log
in using the admin credentials you provided during the
install process. Then select "Upload AIML" from the
navigation link on the left and upload your AIML files.
Then sit back and enjoy your new bot!
