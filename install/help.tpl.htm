        <div>
          This help file is intended to describe the various settings used to install Program O to your website.
          Each section is explained, and when necessary examples are given. Some settings are automatically
          generated, but should be checked carefully for accuracy. For more information, or to ask questions,
          please check out the <a href="http://www.program-o.com/forum/" target="_blank">Program O Forums</a>.<br />

          <div class="description">
            This is the base address for your bot's page. If your bot can be reached at http://www.example.com/myBot/
            then your domain name is www.example.com<br />
            The install script is set up to detect this value automatically, but you should verify the value, just
            to be on the safe side.

          <div class="description">
            If your development server is on a local network, this setting will help Program O to determine the correct
            database settings to use for your bot. Without this setting in place, trying to access your local bot from
            another local network computer could result in errors, as it will try to use the remote database information,
            rather than using the local DB settings. Set this to the local "network name" of your computer.

              The default is one (1) bot, and in most cases the script will automatically set this to the correct value.
              If, for some reason, it doesn't, then you can set it manually.

          <span class="label">Debugging output method</span>
          <div class="description">Default: File<br />
            This setting allows you to choose how to create debugging information in the following ways:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Show in Source</b> Places debugging data in the source code of the page, within
                HTML comment tags. <i>Note - only works when Response Format is set to HTML</i>(See below)
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>File</b> Creates a debug file that's based on the user's internal id and the current time.
                Stored in the /chatbot/debug/ folder.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Display</b> Prints debugging data directly to the screen. <i>Note - only works when Response
                Format is set to HTML</i>(See below)
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>email</b> Sends debugging data via email - <b>WARNING!</b> can create a <u>LOT</u> of email
                traffic! Use sparingly, and with care.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="default_debugshow">
          <span class="label">Debug Level</span>
          <div class="description">
            Here you have a choice of four options:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Nothing</b> No debug data is created. Improves bot performance by a small amount.</li>
              <li><b>General</b> Only basic information is generated.</li>
              <li>
                <b>General/SQL</b> In addition to the data generated in General, above, all SQL statements
                are also recorded.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Everything</b> The results from a vast number of operations, calculations or function calls
                (sometimes several times within certain functions) is generated. <b>WARNING!</b> <u>HUGE</u> amounts
                of data is generated with this setting, to the point where script performance will be affected,
                especially if the debug output method is set to "Show in Source". And for God's sake, <b>DON'T</b>
                use this if you're going to have debugging data sent to your email!
              </li>
            </ul>
            For the most part, this should be set to "Nothing", unless you're trying to trace a problem with your AIML
            files, and even then, it's best to only use "General". The only time the other two settings should be used
            is to troubleshoot the script itself.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="default_save_state">
          <span class="label">Save-State</span>
          <div class="description">
            Default: Session<br />
            Again, you have some options:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Session</b> This is the default behavior, and it causes Program O to save all current user data into a
                single session variable, in array format.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Database</b> Instead of saving the user data in the PHP session array, this saves the data to the
                bot's database instead.
              </li>
            </ul>
            There's no real advantage, one way or the other here. It's simply a matter of preference.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="default_format">
          <span class="label">Response Format</span>
          <div class="description">
            Default: HTML<br />
            Program O gives you three options for parsing your bot's responses:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>HTML</b> This option causes Program O to output responses in HTML format. It's the best way for a
                beginning Botmaster to get started with their bot, because it's the easiest to set up.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>JSON</b> This option causes the script to parse the bot's output as a JSON
                (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JavaScript Object Notation</a>) object, which
                your bot script can use to embed the responses within a currently open HTML page. This method is best
                used by client-side scripts, such as <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>XML</b> Program O can also parse the bot's output as an XML document, which can be used by either
                client-side scripts, server-side scripts, or even stand-alone computer applications. XML is by
                far, the most versatile of the three available options, but it's also the most challenging to use and
                configure.
              </li>
            </ul>
            There are sample pages in the <a href="../gui/index.php">gui directory</a> that you can
            examine and use, but bear in mind that these are simply example pages, and will likely require some
            modification prior to use.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="error_response">
          <span class="label">Error Response String</span>
          <div class="description">
            This is what your bot will say to the user if it encounters an internal error. What you set it to is
            completely up to you, but it <b>must</b> have a value of some sort.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="default_pattern">
          <span class="label">Default Pickup Line Pattern</span>
          Default: *
          <div class="description">
            This is usually best kept as the default pattern, unless you're upgrading from Program O version 1.0,
            which used "RANDOM PICKUP LINE" as the pattern. Even if you <i>are</i> upgrading, you can also leave
            this value as * and modify your AIML pickup line category to use * for it's pattern.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="default_conversation_lines">
          <span class="label">Chat Line Count</span>
          <div class="description">
            This setting tells Program O how many lines of chat to display at a time. Set it to zero (0) for unlimited,
            but beware that this can affect your bot's performance if it gets a lot of users at one time.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row" id="default_remember_up_to">
          <span class="label">History Count</span>
          <div class="description">
            This setting determines how far back your bot "remembers" the conversation. There is no "unlimited"
            setting for this one, since that would eat up resources far more than necessary, and would severely
            affect bot performance. It's suggested that this be set to no more than 30, to prevent undue lag.
