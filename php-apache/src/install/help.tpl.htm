          Much of the information in this section is pretty much self explanatory, but in the interest
          of being thorough, the following items are included. :)
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="bot_name">
          <span class="label">Bot Name</span>
          <div class="description">
          It's been said that names are the cornerstone of existence. Names also have power. Choose your
          bot's name wisely.

          <div class="description">
            This is where you provide whatever "back-story" or attributes you like for your chatbot. Feel
            free to leave this blank, but remember that a more well thought out bot will USUALLY make for
            a higher quality bot.

        <div class="row" id="bot_active">
          <span class="label">Bot Active</span>
          <div class="description">
            In order for a chatbot to be visible and/or usable, it has to be marked in the database as active,
            but there are times when you need to disable or hide your chatbot. Changing this setting in the
            admin pages is the best way to handle that. If you want folks to be able to use your bot, then
            this needs to be set to TRUE (checked).
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="default_aiml_pattern">
          <span class="label">Default Pickup Line Pattern</span>
          <div class="description">
            This is the "default" category that Program O searches for if nothing else matches. Traditionally
            this is set to <strong>RANDOM PICKUP LINE</strong> or <strong>*</strong>, but it can be set to
            pretty much anything (within reason). Whatever you set this to, just make sure that there is an
            AIML category with a &lt;pattern&gt; that matches it.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="error_response">
          <span class="label">Error Response String</span>
          <div class="description">
            This is what your bot will say to the user if it encounters an internal error. What you set it to is
            completely up to you, but it <strong>must</strong> have a value of some sort.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="conversation_lines">
          <span class="label">Chat Line Count</span>
          <div class="description">
            This setting tells Program O how many lines of chat to display at a time. Set it to zero (0) for unlimited,
            but beware that this can affect your bot's performance if it gets a lot of users at one time.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="remember_up_to">
          <span class="label">History Count</span>
          <div class="description">
            This setting determines how far back your bot "remembers" the conversation. There is no "unlimited"
            setting for this one, since that would eat up resources far more than necessary, and would severely
            affect bot performance. It's suggested that this be set to no more than 30, to prevent undue lag.
            If you're using the JSON response setting, you may want to set this to only 1, and use client-side
            scripting to add the responses to a div of (possibly) already existing responses, so as to create
            an "unlimited" chat log for the visitors. Just a suggestion, though. :)
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="format">
          <span class="label">Response Format</span>
          <div class="description">
            Default: HTML<br />
            Program O gives you three options for parsing your bot's responses:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>HTML</strong> This option causes Program O to output responses in HTML format. It's the best way for a
                beginning Botmaster to get started with their bot, because it's the easiest to set up.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>JSON</strong> This option causes the script to parse the bot's output as a JSON
                (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JavaScript Object Notation</a>) object, which
                your bot script can use to embed the responses within a currently open HTML page. This method is best
                used by client-side scripts, such as <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>XML</strong> Program O can also parse the bot's output as an XML document, which can be used by either
                client-side scripts, server-side scripts, or even stand-alone computer applications. XML is by
                far, the most versatile of the three available options, but it's also the most challenging to use and
                configure.
              </li>
            </ul>
            There are sample pages in the <a href="../gui/index.php" target="_blank">GUI directory</a> that you can
            examine and use, but bear in mind that these are simply example pages, and will likely require some
            modification prior to use.

        </div>

        <div class="bold">&nbsp;</div>

        <div class="bold big underline center">Database Configuration</div>

        <div class="bold">&nbsp;</div>

        <div class="bold underline center">Database Connection Info</div>

        <div class="red">
          Please note that you <strong>must</strong> have already created the database for your bot,
          though that database can be empty (the script will create the necessary tables automatically).
          This is so because many web hosting companies do not allow their customers to create new
          databases except through their web hosting control panels.
          Please have the database connection information ready at this point.
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="dbh">
          <span class="label">Database Host Name</span>
          <div class="description">
            Default: localhost<br />
            This setting is part of the local database login credentials that allow Program O to connect to your
            bot's local database. Under the vast majority of circumstances, this is simply 'localhost', but there is
            the occasional rare exception.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="dbPort">
          <span class="label">Database Port</span>
          <div class="description">
            Default: 3306<br />
            Required only in the very rare case that the database server has been configured to use a different port.

        </div>

        <div class="row" id="dbn">
          <span class="label">Database Name</span>
          <div class="description">
            When you performed the task of creating your local database, you should have already named the DB,
            along with configuring username and password. The DB name from that information goes here.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="dbu">
          <span class="label">Database Username</span>
          <div class="description">
            Just as with the name of the database, above, this is part of the connection information that you
            should have gathered when you set up your bot's DB.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="dbp">
          <span class="label">Database Password</span>
          <div class="description">
            This is the password for your script to access your bot's database. There's no confirmation for
            this field, like there was with the admin password, earlier, so be careful to ensure it's entered correctly.
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="description">
            This is the timezone info for server.
            This setting should be automatically set by the installation script, but you should verify it's accuracy.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="bold">&nbsp;</div>

        <div class="bold underline center">Chatbot Administration Info</div>

        <div class="row" id="adm_dbu">
          <span class="label">Admin Area Username</span>
          <div class="description">
            The administration pages for Program O are restricted to the chatbot's administrator, and so
            must be provided with proper credentials. This is the username for the Admin account.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="adm_dbp">
          <span class="label">Admin Area Password</span>
          <div class="description">
            Just like the admin username, this setting is required. This password is encrypted in the
            database, to help improve security.

        </div>

        <div class="bold">&nbsp;</div>

        <div class="bold center underline">Debugging Options</div>

        <div class="row" id="debug_level">
          <span class="label">Debug Level</span>
          <div class="description">
            This setting determines the amount of data generated by the debugging functions. Here you have
            a choice of four options:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Nothing</strong> No debug data is created. Improves bot performance by a small amount.</li>
              <li><strong>General</strong> Only basic information is generated.</li>
              <li>
                <strong>General/SQL</strong> In addition to the data generated in General, above, all SQL statements
                are also recorded.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Everything</strong> The results from a vast number of operations, calculations or function calls
                (sometimes several times within certain functions) is generated. <strong>WARNING!</strong> <u>HUGE</u> amounts
                of data is generated with this setting, to the point where script performance will be affected,
                especially if the debug output method is set to "Show in Source". And for God's sake, <strong>DON'T</strong>
                use this if you're going to have debugging data sent to your email!
              </li>
            </ul>
            For the most part, this should be set to "Nothing", unless you're trying to trace a problem with your AIML
            files, and even then, it's best to only use "General". The only time the other two settings should be used
            is to troubleshoot the script itself.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="debug_mode">
          <span class="label">Debug Mode</span>
          <div class="description">Default: File<br />
            "Debug Mode" is a setting to determine which output method is used for providing debugging data.
            This setting allows you to choose how to obtain debugging information in the following ways:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Show in Source</strong> Places debugging data in the source code of the page, within
                HTML comment tags. <em>Note - only works when Response Format is set to HTML</em>(See below)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>File</strong> Creates a debug file that's based on the user's internal id and the current time.
                Stored in the /chatbot/debug/ folder.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Display</strong> Prints debugging data directly to the screen. <em>Note - only works when Response
                Format is set to HTML</em>(See below)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>email</strong> Sends debugging data via email - <strong>WARNING!</strong> can create a <u>LOT</u> of email
                traffic! Use sparingly, and with care.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row" id="save_state">
          <span class="label">Save State</span>
          <div class="description">
            Default: Session<br />
            This setting determines how Program O will manage user data. Again, you have some options:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Session</strong> This is the default behavior, and it causes Program O to save all current user data into a
                single session variable, in array format.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Database</strong> Instead of saving the user data in the PHP session array, this saves the data to the
                bot's database instead.
              </li>
            </ul>
            There's no real advantage, one way or the other here. It's simply a matter of preference.

        <div class="row">&nbsp;</div>

        <div class="big bold center underline">Troubleshooting</div>

        <div class="row" id="permissions">
          <span class="label">File Permissions</span>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              If you've been directed here, then your web server doesn't allow the install script to modify file permissions automatically.
              If this is the case, then modification of the permissions for the config file will have to be done manually, <strong>BEFORE</strong>
              the install script can continue. Otherwise, you'll end up with a corrupted installation, and will have to start over.
              This problem seems to be limited to Linux systems, since Windows handles file permissions differently.
            </p>
            <p>
              To manually change file permissions on a remote server, you usually have a couple of options. If your hosting provider provides
              a user control panel, you can use the File Management section to change permissions. You can also use the FTP client software
              that you used to upload the file to change permissions. The methods for changing file permissions with an FTP client application
              vary from program to program, so if you're unsure about how to go about the task, try reading your FTP program's Help file.
              Search for either "file permissions", or "CHMOD".
            </p>
            <p>
              The correct setting for the file permissions for the config file is 755. If you're unsure what this means, then have a look at
              <a href="http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml</a> for a good tutorial
              about the CHMOD command, and what the various settings mean. For our purposes, that setting means that the config file can
              only be written to by the file's "owner", while everyone can read and execute the file. If the file can't be properly written
              to, then the script can't save the settings that you've set or changed, and your bot won't work correctly, so it's important
              that the config file has it's permissions set correctly.
