# Contributing

The development team for Program O welcomes contributers who desire to help improve the project,
and we encourage everyone to join in on the fun! We just ask a few things before you do.

## Reporting Issues

Before reporting new issues, please take the time to read [this wiki page](https://github.com/Program-O/Program-O/wiki/Reporting-Issues)
in order to learn what information you can provide that can help up to help you.

## Pull Requests

Please make all pull requests on the `DEV` branch. this is where we _actively_ work on Program O.
The `MASTER` branch is our "__stable__" release version, and only gets updated when we feel that
the `DEV` branch is (relatively) bug free.
