# verbList.dat
#
# ©2011/2012 Geek Cave Creations - Written for use with the Program O AIML Interpreter script
# Written by Dave Morton
#
# contains a list of 1,800+ verbs, for use in determining whether "I" or "me" should be used when transforming a phrase from second person into first person.
# It's also used for verb modification when changing from first person to second or third.
# lines prefixed with # are ignored
# lines prefixed with "~ " indicate a verb that needs no modification.
# lines prefixed with "$ " indicate that first person and second person verbs are the same.
# lines with no prefix are lists of three comma separated words, one for for each "person".
#
# other rules:
# 1.) when first person verbs are the same as second person, then gender-neutral "they" is the same, as well.
# 2.) most past-tense verbs cover all "person" modes, and don't need to be modified.
#
# empty lines are ignored
# line formats:
# 1.) first, second, third
# 2.) $ first/second, third
# 3.) ~ first/second/third
