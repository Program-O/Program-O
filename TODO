1.) Add functionality for botmasters to see what inputs triggered the default
  response category, so that they may be able to more easily determine what
  AIML categories need to be added.

2.) Add a page to the admin script that helps botmasters create new AIML categories
  based on the functionality mentioned in item 1, above.

3.) Add a page to the admin script that allows botmasters to edit the config file
  directly.

4.) Add config options for enable/disable of BBCode, spell check and word censor addons

5.) Create configurable functionality to delete users and conversation entries that are
  older than a given amount of time (defalts to 30 days)

6.) Add ability to delete selected files from both log and debug file viewers
